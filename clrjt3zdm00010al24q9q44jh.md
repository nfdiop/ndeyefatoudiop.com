I love reading newsletters.

But let's be honest, many are just a waste of time.

If you want to boost your developer career, here are the 5 that are truly worth your time:

## 1. [High Growth Engineer](https://careercutler.substack.com/)

I like this newsletter because it addresses common questions software engineers have. Jordan's journey, transitioning from a Junior to a Senior Engineer in just 2 years, is genuinely inspiring.

## 2. [Work Chronicles](https://workchronicles.com/) by @_workchronicles

Whenever I feel stressed or overwhelmed, I turn to this newsletter. Its fantastic comics never fail to lift my mood and help me realize that my struggles are shared.

## 3. [The Developing Dev](https://www.developing.dev/) by @ryanlpeterman

This newsletter is a treasure trove of valuable resources, including templates, insightful tips, and recommendations. It is an excellent guide for navigating your career and provides valuable insights on maximizing your impact.

## 4. [Engineering Leadership](https://newsletter.eng-leadership.com/) by @gregorojstersek

This newsletter is mainly for more senior engineers, but it would still be relevant to junior devs. It delves into often overlooked aspects of software engineering, offering insights on being business-minded and strategies for growing into leadership positions.

## 5. [Elevate](https://addyo.substack.com/) by @addyosmani

I recently found this newsletter, and I'm thrilled with the content. @addyosmani, a fantastic developer, shares his powerful insights on various subjects.
