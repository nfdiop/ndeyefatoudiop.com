Mastering front-end development is hard.

At first, things might be easy. Maybe you were able to render your first interactive elements or use CSS for the first time.

However, as soon as you try to build complex projects, you feel overwhelmed. There are just too many resources out there, too many things to learn: CSS, JS, React, npm, bundlers, etc.

Luckily, you have everything you need to become proficient and even get hired as a front-end developer—all available online **for free**.
