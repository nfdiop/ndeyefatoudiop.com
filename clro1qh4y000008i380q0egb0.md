Substack is seriously **underrated**.

If you're on it, you know exactly what I'm talking about.

But if you aren't, here's why:

## Reason #1: You get direct access to practical advice from accomplished developers

Twitter is great for inspiration, and Reddit is excellent for finding help.

However, if you are a developer who has just started their career and wants to excel, check Substack. The advice is direct, tailored to your daily tasks (no pointless debates about the best framework), and comes from developers with a proven track record like @GergelyOrosz, @highgrowtheng, @gregorojstersek.

## Reason #2: You can access a lot of great content for free (even if you can subscribe for more)

While some newsletters may require a subscription, many already provide free access. Even paid newsletters often offer complimentary posts.

## Reason #3: You can continue interacting with more people through Substack notes

I recently stumbled upon this, and I'm loving it. It's perfect for staying updated on what's new and connecting with fellow developers.

## Reason #4: No built-in ads on the Substack platform

If, like me, you're fed up with annoying or irrelevant ads cluttering your feed, you will love Substack. Enjoy scrolling through notes without the hassle of any ads 😉.
