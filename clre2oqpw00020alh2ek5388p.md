It's not easy staying motivated.

Especially if you're going through job interviews as a junior developer.

But anytime you feel like giving up, turn back to these 5 simple quotes (to remind you why you're doing what you're doing):

## _"Don't be a donkey"_ -¬†Derek Sivers

When the temptation to jump ship to the next big thing (new framework, language, project, etc.) hits me, I read this quote. It's a friendly reminder to stay focused and play the long game.

## _"You can't produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant."_¬†- Warren Buffet

We all wished we could start coding on day 1 and land a job on day 10. Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way, and finding a junior dev position may take time. This quote keeps me grounded, reminding me that becoming a great dev takes time.

## _"You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them."_¬†- Maya Angelou

I go back to this quote whenever things don't go as expected. I relied on it a lot when I was getting interview rejections. It's a reminder that setbacks happen, but we can choose not to let them bring us down.

## _"I have self-doubt. I have insecurity. I have fear of failure. I have nights when I show up at the arena and I'm like, 'My back hurts, my feet hurt, my knees hurt. I don't have it. I just want to chill.' We all have self-doubt. You don't deny it, but you also don't capitulate to it. You embrace it."_ -¬†Kobe Bryant

This is easily one of my favorites. This quote gives me strength whenever I need to do something challenging but don't want to.

## _"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer"_ -¬†Albert Einstein

A few years back, I stumbled upon this quote, and it worked like magic. Einstein, attributing his success to persisting through challenges, inspired me. I thought, 'If Einstein did it, why can't I?' It was a game-changer for me.
