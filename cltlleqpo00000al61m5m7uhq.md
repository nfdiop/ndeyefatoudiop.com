There are a lot of books/courses about React.

And I've read/purchased a lot of them over the past +5 years.

Unfortunately, I find many of them to be either bloated or too superficial - while still being expensive.

But recently, I have read a book called [**Advanced React**](https://www.advanced-react.com/) by ***Nadia Makarevich*** that I believe is the best investment to make if you want to master React.

## For a few reasons:

**Reason #1: It covers everything you might find tricky as a junior dev and need to know to be a React expert.** The book discusses everything you need to learn to be really good at React, like how renders work, refs, context, and more. Back when I started over 5 years ago, I wish I had this book â€“ it could've saved me from some confusing state issues.

**Reason #2: It is well-written with a lot of illustrations.** I love books that make hard stuff easy to understand, and this one does it really well. All the concepts are explained with nice and simple pictures.

**Reason #3: It stays practical.** If you are looking for a book that gets straight to the point without going off track, choose this one. You can use what you learn right away at work.

**Reason #4: It's concise.** With only 314 pages, it's a quick read. You get the essential information without unnecessary fluff.

**Reason #5: It's affordable.** At just $32, it's a bargain compared to other React resources.

If you want to master React, I can't recommend this book enough.
