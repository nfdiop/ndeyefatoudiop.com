In 2017, I was **failing** all my coding interviews.

I wanted to land a job at a high-tech company. So, I would spend hours practicing on *LeetCode*. Still, I would fail to solve any new problem or, worse, fail at problems I've already solved before.

Until one day, a **Google** software engineer said to me:

## "You can't succeed without first understanding Data Structures & Algorithms."

That day, my whole life changed.

I realized that, indeed, he was right. Since I didn't have a proper CS degree, I wasn't comfortable with data structures like *trees*, *priority queues*, or algorithms like *DFS* (Depth-First Search), *BFS* (Breadth-First Search), etc.

So I decided to pick up a book: ***"Introduction to Algorithms, MIT Press"*** and go through it during my entire holiday break.

This was another AHA moment. After reading this book:

* I could finally make sense of `big O` notation
    
* I could solve a ton of problems with `DFS`, `BFS`,...
    
* etc.
    

I also realized that there were some common patterns for solving problems. Thus, just learning one opened the door to solving multiple challenges.

As a **result**, I was able to:

* pass several interviews at companies like Bloomberg, Yelp
    
* get a job offer at Pinterest, where I actually had to solve a *tree* problem ü§£
    
* and more importantly, land my current job
