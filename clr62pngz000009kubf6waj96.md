Today, there are a ton of VSCode extensions for just about anything.

But when it comes to **Frontend**, there are seven extensions I can't live without:

## Extension #1: Better Comments

This extension helps you write more human-friendly comments, enabling quick code **scanning for essential elements** like TODOs and highlights.

## Extension #2: Code Spell Checker

Before this extension, I'd often get typo comments on my PRs. That meant going back, making changes, and waiting for CI again. With this extension, those days are history—I now know all **my code is typo-free**.

## Extension #3: File Utils

This extension makes file manipulation (rename, delete, duplicate) a breeze.

Extension #4: GitHub Copilot

Seriously, I can't believe I survived without this extension. It works wonders in speeding up my coding, and I can't get enough of the **comments auto-completion**.

## Extension #5: GitLens — Git supercharged

Git users, if you don't have this extension yet, stop and install it now. It makes everything, from finding the author of a line to checking commit history, much more convenient.

## Extension #6: GitHub Pull Requests and Issues

If, like me, you are too lazy to navigate to the pull requests page and create one, download this extension. It lets you effortlessly **create PRs directly from VSCode**. Plus, you can easily **read/edit PR comments directly within VSCode**.

## Extension #7: Turbo Console Log
I love this extension. It helps you craft meaningful messages, making them easy to spot in a sea of console logs.
