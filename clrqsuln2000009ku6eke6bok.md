I have reviewed more than 1,000 frontend pull requests.

Like many junior developers, I made some common mistakes when I started.

If you're in the same boat, here are 5 small mistakes you can quickly fix to keep your code clean and performant:

**Mistake #1: Creating a state that can be derived from props + existing state**
If you can calculate a value from existing props, please do so. Creating a state for it adds complexity and raises the risk of state discrepancies (some updated, others not).

**Mistake #2: Using `items.length && <MyComponent />`**
Let's say you only want to render a component when a list is non-empty. So you use `items.length && <MyComponent />`. The problem is that this code will print 0 on the screen when the list is empty. Instead, use `items.length > 0 && <MyComponent />`.

**Mistake #3: Using `useEffect` unnecessarily or dangerously**
Be cautious with the dependencies list in useEffect; if poorly set, it might crash your app or lead to inconsistent UI. Additionally, try to minimize its use for better performance and code readability.

**Mistake #4: Having multiple setState vs. combining into a single state or using reducer**
If you have multiple pieces of state that are strongly correlated, avoid multiple `setState`. Instead, opt for a single setState or use useReducer to maintain cleaner code.

**Mistake #5: Accidentally breaking the component memoization**
A common mistake, especially for beginners, is breaking the memoization created by `React.memo`. Make sure you don't accidentally pass objects or arrow functions, as it renders memoization ineffective.
