I recently signed up for Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole's cohort-based course, Ship 30 for 30.

## Here are a few reasons why:

**Reason 1: I want to provide tips for overwhelmed junior frontend devs**

Over the past few years, I've received soo many questions about how to get into tech, how to navigate the tech world, etc. Writing online will allow me to answer these questions.

**Reason 2: I want to convince "younger me" that she can thrive as a software developer**

I wish I had seen people "like me" write about software development when I just got started. It would have given me the confidence to believe that I, too, belong to that world and can thrive in it. So I hope my writing will inspire people, especially minorities.

**Reason 3: I want writing to be second nature**

I hate writing because I obsess over words, images, grammar, etc. This challenge will push me to write daily and break my perfectionism.

Over the next 30 days, I will share tips on navigating your career as a junior front-end developer and how to avoid common mistakes.

Join me on this adventureâ€”and let me know if you have any questions along the way!

I'm excited to start sharing what I know online.
