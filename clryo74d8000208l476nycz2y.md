Do you want to work as a junior frontend developer in a big tech company?

I've been a software engineer for over 5 years, specializing in frontend engineering for the past 3 years. From my experience, landing this role requires:

Passing complex coding interviews,

Demonstrating a knack for problem-solving and

Showing your ability to learn quickly

So, here's the 1 tip I would give you if you wanted to pursue a similar career path:

## Cultivate unwavering confidence in yourself and your ability to succeed.

If you don't believe in yourself, you'll have a hard time landing a great job for 3 reasons:

- **Reason #1: You'll struggle to convince your interviewer that you're the right person for the job.** In fact, if you keep second-guessing, it signals you might struggle with real-world challenges, wasting time undoing and redoing decisions.

- **Reason #2: You're more likely to quit when faced with setbacks.** There was a time when I thought I could never be a developer. Because of that, every problem seemed insurmountable. Shifting to believing in myself cleared doubts, allowing me to focus on gaining the right skills.

- **Reason #3: Settling becomes tempting.** When you don't believe in yourself, you might accept less than you're worth. Remember, at big companies, you can generally negotiate. Undervalue yourself, and you'll likely lowball.
