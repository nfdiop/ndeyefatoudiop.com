Finding the best frontend framework is a **myth**.

That's what I realized after **3+ years** of frontend development experience.

If there were an ultimate one, new frameworks wouldn't pop in so often, and we would all be using the same.

Instead, follow these rules to pick one 👇:

## How to pick a framework depending on your situation:

- **You are a complete newbie 🐣.** At this stage, don't bother with frameworks. Instead, focus on understanding JavaScript fundamentals. Without a strong foundation, mastering any of these frameworks will be challenging.

- **You understand JavaScript deeply 💪.** Great! Build a project using Vanilla JavaScript first, and then replicate it with any of the frameworks you're interested in. This way, you can compare and determine which one you find more comfortable.

- **You are a junior developer looking for a job 🕵️.** Go through the job descriptions and identify the requirements. If most of the jobs you're interested in demand React, then learn React. If they lean towards Vue, pick up Vue, and so on. Simple, isn't it?

- **You just started a job as a junior developer 🎉.** Congrats! Learn the framework your team is using. If they aren't using any, find out the reasons behind it. If there's no clear basis and you believe a framework could benefit the team, talk to them about how to introduce one.

- **You are working on your side hustle 🍳.** Just choose one or stick to Vanilla JS based on your skills and goals.

- **You are self-employed 🤳.** Choose any framework or stick to Vanilla JS. Just be cautious about selecting an overly niche framework, as it could be hard to hire in the future.

- **You dream of an unicorn 🦄.** Fantastic! Choose the most comfortable one or none at all, as your focus should be on validating your ideas.

To sum it up, as a developer, your goal is to build something, and any of these frameworks can help you achieve that. So, don't sweat about finding the perfect one—just choose the one that aligns with your goals and skill level.
