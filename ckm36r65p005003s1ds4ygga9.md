# Building my first PWA with Next.js, ChakraUI, Typescript, Firebase, and Web Workers (Intro: The good, the bad, and the ugly)

It was January 15, 2021.

I was scrolling on Hashnode when I stumbled upon this article:  [Announcing Hashnode Hackathon Powered by Vercel](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-hashnode-hackathon-powered-by-vercel).

I never participated in a hackathon before, but I thought to myself: *"How hard could it be?"*. I used NextJs + Vercel for this blog, and it could be a fun learning experience. Plus, I long wanted an **app to track my higher-level goals and the actions I take towards them**. So here we go 💪🏾.

Three weeks later..., the hackathon closed, and I **wasn't even close to done** 😅.

I don't know if it is because of my inexperience or my propensity to complicate things, but I made many **mistakes** in the process. At the same time, I learned a ton about NextJS, Firebase, server-side-rendering, etc. **That is why I decided to start this series to share my learnings with you. **

*PS: I am still building the app, and you can track my progress on  [Github](https://github.com/Joyancefa/goalswin).*

## Part I: Designing the app

This part was straightforward: I use  [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html)  (which is free), and I collected ideas from  [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). You can see the mocks further.

#### The good ✅
I shared the mocks on Twitter, and so far, this is my most successful  [tweet](https://twitter.com/joyancefa/status/1353349268707405824)  with > 250 reactions. Plus, I could gauge people's interest.

#### The bad 🤯
I am not a designer, so I had to spend some time picking up colors, fonts, designing mocks, etc. 

#### The ugly ❌
I spent **20h doing the mocks** => I could have spent this time building the app 😅.

## Part II: Choosing a tech stack

This part wasn't the easiest, and I made some (costly) mistakes with my early decisions (looking at you AWS 🤏🏾). These are the libraries that I finally choose:

### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

![typescript.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1615361830569/A01DJVFu1.png)

#### The good ✅

**Adding Typescript to your JS project is like adding your dating type in your dating profile** 😉. Other people know what you expect, and you will get suggestions for the types you mentioned. **Similarly**, when you use Typescript, the other developers know what parameters a function expects, the type of a variable, etc. IDEs (like VSCode) can flag you when you're using the wrong type, give you suggestions, etc.

*PS: If you want to get started with Typescript, check this  [guide](https://kodeinstincts.hashnode.dev/typescript-beginner-start-here?guid=e3ec5af7-4eac-435d-ac0c-8c71eefccb42&deviceId=b85a9a6b-30ab-4c7d-985f-c1a31aa81998).*

#### The bad 🤯
Similar to how setting up expectations in a dating app is great, it also limits the pool of people you can date. Plus, **you have to stay consistent**. Typescript is the same; once you start using it, you have to respect the types and specify a type for everything: which can get laborious. 

#### The ugly ❌
- I realized that my project is **slower to build/rebuild** when using Typescript vs. pure JS.
- I ended up using the ***any*** type in a couple of cases; this defeats the purpose of using Typescript (read more  [here](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/typescript-stop-using-any-there-s-a-type-for-that))

### [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

![nextjs.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1615361884861/yQBK1TN_y.png)

#### The good ✅
I discovered NextJS last year: I used it to create  [this blog](http://frontendjoy.com/), and it was a great experience 🙂. It helps you set up an **optimized React project** with [server-side rendering](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-server-side-rendering) and **no initial setup**. Plus, the community is excellent, and the company keeps improving the product.

#### The bad 🤯
I **didn't know NextJS well enough** 😅. True, I could build a blog, but I wasn't solid on the fundamentals: I didn't even know what server-side rendering implied. Nor did I know :
- The difference between getStaticProps, getServerSideProps,...
- How the pages API worked
- Etc.

#### The ugly ❌
Nothing to report 😀

### [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

![chakra.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1615361960457/ZJVk9Psk5.png)

#### The good ✅

I discovered Chakra through  [leerob's blog](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io), and I am in love ❤️ with it since then. As a React developer, it is the **quickest way to build beautiful (but accessible) UIs**.

#### The bad 🤯
My app would work in dev mode but not in prod. After hours of debugging, I discovered that **some Chakra components don't work with Preact + NextJS** ([issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/3099)). In fact, for performance reasons, I use  [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)  instead of React in production mode. I had to decide between redesigning the components or dropping Preact: I choose to redesign, which takes time.

#### The ugly ❌
- Chakra is a JS library, and unfortunately, **JS is more expansive than CSS**. If I were using CSS only or TailwindCSS, my app would be more performant, but it would take me more time. 
- It loads some unnecessary JS like some [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) JS; this affects the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) score 😥.

### [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

![firebase.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1615362293178/RwKMjhj-q.png)

I **didn't start with Firebase** (alternatives [here](https://joyancefa.com/work-in-progress-goalswin-set-your-goals-and-track-your-habits)) because I didn't find it very novel => **I should have** 🤦🏾‍♀️.

#### The good ✅

- There is a ton of documentation around Firebase.
- You don't have any config or decision to make (i.e., which machine to use, how many cores, etc.).
- You can start for free.
- It is "easy" to set up authentication/authorization.

#### The bad 🤯
Like for NextJS, I have **basic knowledge of Firebase**, so I have to learn along the way => which takes time.

#### The ugly ❌
Firebase **increases your JS bundles** (i.e., the user has to download more JS to use your app) => this is why I use web workers.

### [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)

#### The good ✅

- I always wanted to learn about web workers. This is the first time I use them: exciting 🥳.
- The web workers' script **loads lazily**, which is excellent for perf.
- I can use my main thread only for UI (i.e., Chakra, charts, etc.)

#### The bad 🤯
- If you've read through this, you likely noticed that I picked technologies I am not familiar with 😅. I am also **not familiar with Web workers**: so I can't count the time I spent debugging issues.
- Using Web workers **adds complexity to the code**.

#### The ugly ❌
- Web workers **can't access the DOM** and have limited access to the window object's methods. Thus I had to find a workaround for Google, Twitter, or Github Firebase authentication. Methods like [signInWithPopup](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.auth.Auth#signinwithpopup), [signInWithRedirect](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.auth.Auth#signinwithredirect) don't work with web workers. 
- Any **object** shared between a web worker, and the main thread **must work with the [structured clone algorithm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm)**.

## Where I am at right now
I finally made the authentication work with Firebase + web workers 🎉. As a next step, I will let the user choose a username + create categories/goals. In parallel, I bought a  [fireship.io](https://fireship.io/)  subscription to learn the best way to model data on Firebase 🙂.
