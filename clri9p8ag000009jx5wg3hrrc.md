The [_You Don't Know JS_](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) book series by @getifyX is the best book ever written on Vanilla Javascript.

You know exactly what I'm talking about if you've read it.

But if you haven't, here's why:

## Reason #1: This book series contains everything you need to know about JS

Spanning 6 books, the series covers everything you need to know about JS. It's a revelation—reading it made me realize how much I didn't know. Concepts I attributed to React turned out to be fundamental JavaScript features. It's a game-changer for anyone serious about understanding the language.

## Reason #2: They use an unfiltered, concise language

If you want honest, concise language, pick this book. No fluff. Packed with examples, quizzes, and summaries, it distills complex concepts into digestible bits, accelerating your understanding of JavaScript.

## Reason #4: They are laser-focused on Javascript

Unlike many online resources that skim the surface of various topics, this series dives deep into JavaScript and JavaScript only. It's fantastic for building solid fundamentals.

## Reason #3: They are free to read online

These invaluable resources are available online for free on GitHub. Yes, free! You can also purchase the paper version if you want.

I can't recommend this book enough.
