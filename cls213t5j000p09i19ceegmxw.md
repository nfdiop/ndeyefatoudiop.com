There are many things most people don't know about Big Tech/MAANG companies.

For example, did you know...

- Many of them let you bring your dog to the office 🐾
- You can generally enjoy free food 🍔 and awesome goodies
- You get stock-based compensation that is often higher than your base salary 💸

For anyone in the industry, this stuff is common knowledge.

But to those who haven't lived "a day in the life" as a Software Engineer in Big Tech, some might come as a shock.

For example, here's the weirdest thing most people don't know related to recruiting at Big Tech companies:

## You get a 💰 referral bonus when someone you've referred lands the job!

Crazy, right? You recommend someone and get some extra cash if they get hired.

This is super cool because you get to help someone, but at the same time, you "share" their success. It looks like free money, but hiring is generally expensive for companies: it requires outreach, going through the process, etc.

So, when employees refer candidates, it's a great deal for both.

**Now, as a junior developer, why is this relevant to you?** If you're struggling with the regular recruiting process, prep your resume and skills. Then, hit up people on LinkedIn. If they think you're a good fit, they have a good reason to recommend you 😉, making the hiring process smoother and faster.
